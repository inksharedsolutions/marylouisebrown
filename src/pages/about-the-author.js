                                I am married and live in Pennsylvania. I have two cats and one service dog that keep me busy. I have had pets my entire life. I had belonged to the Cat Fancier Association and that is how I got involved with showing cats as a hobby. During that time, I learned many things about cats. Stormie, the main character, is my cat and she does many crazy things, and that is how I came up with the idea for this book. I have also studied psychology. I have also been fire police as well as an EMT. I have worked as a restaurant manager before starting my writing career.
